When writing programs with an emphasis on maintainability and readability, I focus on keeping my code modular and well documented throughout the process. For example in my work on the CRUD Python module from project one, I structured the code so that it was reusable and easily adaptable to future changes. By encapsulating database operations in a class I was able to keep the logic separate from the rest of the application which made it easier to maintain and even build upon for project two. Using this approach I then connected the dashboard widgets to the database in project two. This modular approach made future updates such as adding new fields or changing the database structure much easier without requiring significant changes to the rest of the code base. In the future, this CRUD module could be used in other projects that require database interactions such as other dashboard applications I may develop in future projects.
As a computer scientist I approach problems methodically in order to break them down into smaller and more manageable pieces. For example when working on the Grazioso Salvare dashboard and database requirements I first analyzed the system's needs. These needs being finding out what data was essential, how it should be structured and in what ways should the database interact with dashboard elements. My approach to this project was different from previous assignments in other courses because it required integrating multiple technologies to make one fluid application. I had to understand how each component interacts and ensure seamless communication between them. In future projects I can apply this same approach but tailor it to the specific requirements of the project, whether it involves using more complex data models, integrating additional third party libraries, or ensuring the system is scalable over time.
Computer scientists are problem solvers, and they apply algorithms, data structures, and technology to design solutions for various problems. The work they do is critical because it enables companies and organizations to automate processes, improve overall efficiency, and make better decisions based on easily digestible data. In the case of Grazioso Salvare my work on creating a well structured database and dashboard allows the organization to easily manage and visualize animal shelters and make informed decisions in a much more time efficient manner. Building this system helps the company streamline its operations by reducing the manual effort required to process and display the large amounts of data.
